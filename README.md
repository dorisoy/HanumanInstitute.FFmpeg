# HanumanInstitute.FFmpeg (FFmpeg.Net)
Cross-platform .Net wrapper for media encoders such as FFmpeg, X264 and X265, including Avisynth and VapourSynth support.

<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/HanumanInstitute.FFmpeg/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/HanumanInstitute.FFmpeg.svg"></a>

## Features
- Manages processes programatically (start, track, cancel).
- Parses process output from FFmpeg, X264 or X265 to track progress and create a rich user interface.
- Provides easy access to common functions, and can be extended to call and track any other console process.
- Can pipe Avisynth and VapourSynth scripts into FFmpeg, X264 and X265 and will manage processes accordingly.
- Can be extended to support additional encoders.
- Fully tested with unit tests so it just works.
- **Works on Windows, Linux and MacOS.**
- Includes cross-platform sample using Avalonia UI.

## Usage without IOC container

1. Create a EncoderService containing the application configuration settings.

2. Use GetMediaEncoder, GetMediaInfoReader, GetMediaMuxer and GetMediaScript on IEncoderService.

3. Call any of the operations such as MediaInfoReader.GetFileInfo.

All operations take 2 parameters: Options and Callback.

**Options** will be explained in ProcessOptions section.

**Callback** plugs into the ProcessStarted event and allows grabbing a reference to ProcessWorker.

```c#
var Service = new EncoderService(Options.Create(new AppPaths() {
    FFmpeg = "ffmpeg-x64" // exclude .exe to work on Linux/MacOS
}));
var InfoReader = Service.GetMediaInfoReader(Factory);
IProcessWorker Worker;
var FileInfo = InfoReader.GetFileInfo("file.mp4", null, (_, e) => Worker = e.ProcessWorker);
```

## Usage with IOC container

1. Register into your IOC container of choice

```c#
SplatRegistrations.RegisterLazySingleton<IEncoderService, EncoderService>();
SplatRegistrations.RegisterConstant(Options.Create(new AppPaths()));
SplatRegistrations.RegisterLazySingleton<IProcessManager, ProcessManager>();
SplatRegistrations.RegisterLazySingleton<IUserInterfaceManager, FFmpegUserInterfaceManager>();
SplatRegistrations.Register<IMediaEncoder, MediaEncoder>();
SplatRegistrations.Register<IMediaMuxer, MediaMuxer>();
SplatRegistrations.Register<IMediaInfoReader, MediaInfoReader>();
SplatRegistrations.Register<IMediaScript, MediaScript>();
```

2. Inject `IMediaEncoder`, `IMediaMuxer`, `IMediaInfoReader` or `IMediaScript` into your class constructor.

3. Set the `Owner property, which gets passed to `IUserInterfaceManager` if you implement it.

```c#
private readonly IMediaEncoder _encoder;
private readonly IMediaMuxer _muxer;

public MainViewModel(IMediaMuxer mediaMuxer, IMediaEncoder mediaEncoder)
{
    _encoder = mediaEncoder;
    _encoder.Owner = this;
    _muxer = mediaMuxer;
    _muxer.Owner = this;
}
```

## Configuring Application Paths

EncoderService and ProcessManager take an argument of type `IOptions<AppPaths>`, which is the standard .NET approach to handling configurations. [Read more about Options Pattern in ASP.Net Core.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

Configuring it in a desktop application can be as simple as calling `Options.Create(myAppPaths)` (requires `Microsoft.Extensions.Options`).

If you want to configure the values in `appsettings.json` file, you can do this (ASP.NET loads it automatically but we can do it manually for desktop). Requires `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder`.

```c#
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.json", true, true);
var config = builder.Build();
var paths = config.GetSection("AppPaths").Get<FFmpeg.AppPaths>();

return new EncoderService(Options.Create(paths);
```

long **TotalFrameCount** : When running several tasks at once, gets or sets the amount of frames for the entire job. If 0, it will be calculated using FrameCount and ResumePos.

long **ResumePos** : If resuming a job, gets or sets the number of frames that were done previously.

## Cancelling Processes

By default, canceling tasks is done with a soft kill to let the process close its files in a clean state. 
**This implementation, however, won't work for Console Applications.** If you are using this class in a 
console application, you must handle MediaConfig.CloseProcess event and implement a work-around as 
described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29274238/3960200); or simply call ProcessWorker.Kill if you don't mind a hard kill.

## Parsing Custom Application

If you want to use an additional application and don't need to parse the process updates, simply use ProcessWorker and don't worry about the output.

If you want to parse the output of an additional application, follow these steps:

1. Create a class that implements IFileInfoParser (see FileInfoX264 for a sample).

2. Create a class that implements IFileInfoParserFactory to support the additional application name which will be identified by a string.

3. When creating your ProcessWorkerFactory, use the overload where you supply all the dependencies to pass your custom IFileInfoParserFactory.

4. Handle `IProcessManager.GetCustomAppPath` event to return the path of the custom application.

5. Call ProcessWorkerEncoder.RunEncoder and specify your custom application name.

## Cool Usages

1. **Avisynth Pause/Resume.** Encoding videos with Avisynth can take a long time, and crashes may occur, or you may
want to use your computer for something else while it is running. The provided interface makes it easy to run 
Avisynth via avs2pipemod and pipe the output to FFmpeg. The user can then click "Cancel" to stop the job in a clean state,
and you can count the number of encoded frames, edit the script to start at that position, and resume from there. 
Once the whole video has been processed, you can use MediaMuxer.Concatenate to merge all the segments and voilà!

2. **Multi-Tasking.** You may need to run several tasks, some in parallel and some in sequence. For example, 
while the video is encoding, you may want to extract the audio to WAV and run OpusEnc or NeroAac to encode the audio in parallel.
Once both the audio and video and done, you then may want to muxe them back together. You can manage that whole process in the
same UI window by first calling FFmpegConfig.UserInterfaceManager.Start with a JobId and calling FFmpegConfig.UserInterfaceManager.End 
when done. All processes started with that JobId will be routed to the same UI. Tasks with IsMainTask will be parsed allowing 
you to display FFmpeg's progress with a progress bar, while tasks with IsMainTask=false will allow displaying 
"Extracting audio", "Encoding Audio" and "Muxing Audio and Video" while those are running in the background. You can also easily
track and cancel the whole chain of commands.
