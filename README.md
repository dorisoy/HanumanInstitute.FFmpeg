# EmergenceGuardian.Encoder (.NET FFmpeg Wrapper)
.Net wrapper for media encoders such as FFmpeg, X264 and X265, including Avisynth and VapourSynth support.

[NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EmergenceGuardian.Encoder/)

## Features
- Manages processes programatically (start, track, cancel).
- Parses process output from FFmpeg, X264 or X265 to track progress and create a rich user interface.
- Provides easy access to common functions, and can be extended to call and track any other console process.
- Can pipe Avisynth and VapourSynth scripts into FFmpeg, X264 and X265 and will manage processes accordingly. 10-bit videos are supported.
- Can be extended to support additional encoders.
- Designed using Dependency Injection principles.
- Fully tested with unit tests so it just works.

## Usage

1. Create a ProcessWorkerFactory containing the application configuration settings.

2. Create MediaEncoder, MediaInfoReader, MediaMuxer or MediaScript using that factory.

3. Call any of the operations such as MediaInfoReader.GetFileInfo.

All operations take 2 parameters: Options and Callback.

**Options** will be explained in ProcessOptions section.

**Callback** plugs into the ProcessStarted event and allows grabbing a reference to ProcessWorker.

```c#
var Factory = new ProcessWorkerFactory(new MediaConfig() {
    FFmpegPath = Properties.Settings.Default.FFmpegPath
});
var InfoReader = new MediaInfoReader(Factory);
IProcessWorker Worker;
IFileInfoFFmpeg FileInfo = InfoReader.GetFileInfo("file.mp4", null, (s, e) => Worker = e.ProcessWorker);
```

long **FrameCount** : Gets or sets the frame count to use when it is not automatically provided by the input file.

long **TotalFrameCount** : When running several tasks at once, gets or sets the amount of frames for the entire job. If 0, it will be calculated using FrameCount and ResumePos.

long **ResumePos** : If resuming a job, gets or sets the number of frames that were done previously.

## Cancelling Processes

By default, canceling tasks is done with a soft kill to let the process close its files in a clean state. 
**This implementation, however, won't work for Console Applications.** If you are using this class in a 
console application, you must handle MediaConfig.CloseProcess event and implement a work-around as 
described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29274238/3960200); or simply call ProcessWorker.Kill if you don't mind a hard kill.

## Parsing Custom Application

If you want to use an additional application and don't need to parse the process updates, simply use ProcessWorker and don't worry about the output.

If you want to parse the output of an additional application, follow these steps:

1. Create a class that implements IFileInfoParser (see FileInfoX264 for a sample).

2. Create a class that implements IFileInfoParserFactory to support the additional application name which will be identified by a string.

3. When creating your ProcessWorkerFactory, use the overload where you supply all the dependencies to pass your custom IFileInfoParserFactory.

4. Handle MediaConfig.GetCustomAppPath event to return the path of the custom application.

5. Call ProcessWorkerEncoder.RunEncoder and specify your custom application name.

## Cool Usages

1. **Avisynth Pause/Resume.** Encoding videos with Avisynth can take a long time, and crashes may occur, or you may
want to use your computer for something else while it is running. The provided interface makes it easy to run 
Avisynth via avs2pipemod and pipe the output to FFmpeg. The user can then click "Cancel" to stop the job in a clean state,
and you can count the number of encoded frames, edit the script to start at that position, and resume from there. 
Once the whole video has been processed, you can use MediaMuxer.Concatenate to merge all the segments and voilà!

2. **Multi-Tasking.** You may need to run several tasks, some in parallel and some in sequence. For example, 
while the video is encoding, you may want to extract the audio to WAV and run OpusEnc or NeroAac to encode the audio in parallel.
Once both the audio and video and done, you then may want to muxe them back together. You can manage that whole process in the
same UI window by first calling FFmpegConfig.UserInterfaceManager.Start with a JobId and calling FFmpegConfig.UserInterfaceManager.End 
when done. All processes started with that JobId will be routed to the same UI. Tasks with IsMainTask will be parsed allowing 
you to display FFmpeg's progress with a progress bar, while tasks with IsMainTask=false will allow displaying 
"Extracting audio", "Encoding Audio" and "Muxing Audio and Video" while those are running in the background. You can also easily
track and cancel the whole chain of commands.
